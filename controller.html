          <p>
            This question and the other questions in this section asked a series
            of statements relating to a specific aspect of accessibility design
            and how much participants agreed or disagreed with those statements.
            When looking at how people responded to that question it shows that
            there was mostly a strong agreement/disagreement with only a couple
            of statements which received a mixed response.<br /><br />
            Some of the strongest responses were to the statements asking about
            gyro controls where about 75% or more people agreed with the
            statements. In particular, 58.6% of participants strongly agreed
            that gyro controls felt comfortable to use and 34.5% strongly
            agreeing that gyro controls had a large and varied range of
            sensitivity settings. Participants also agreed that vibration
            feedback from the controller was comfortable although, less people
            strongly agreed compared to the previous statements. Finally, most
            people agreed that when the game requires you to rapidly press a
            button on the controller, it was uncomfortable.<br /><br />
            There were two statements that respondents mostly disagreed with.
            These included stick controls being comfortable and holding down
            buttons for inputs being uncomfortable, 72.1% and 76.2% respectively
            disagreed with the statements.<br /><br />
            Some statements received mixed responses, these included stick
            controls having a variety of settings to customise, stick controls
            having a large range of sensitivity options and button mapping
            having a variety of remapping options. These statements saw an
            agree/disagree split of 48.3%/51.7%, 58%/42% and 43.1%/56.9%
            respectively. For these statements there was a much more even
            proportion of agreement and disagreement.<br /><br />
            Overall, this shows people are generally happy with the current
            implementation of gyro controls and their settings as well as the
            vibration feedback from the controller. Opinions about stick
            controls were a lot more mixed with the comfortability of stick
            controls being a main issue for people. Lastly, button mapping and
            rapid button pressing were also seen as problems.

            Questions 9 - 13 allow multiple answers to be selected so the
            percentages are shown in the graph below. This question asks
            participants to select accessibility options they would like to be
            added into Splatoon 3. <br /><br />
            The most popular option was the inclusion of gyroscopic sensitivity
            sliders for both the x and the y axis with almost 60% of people
            surveyed selecting that option. The 2nd most popular option was to
            include a greater range of sensitivity for the gyro aim with 39.4%.
            the rest of the options range from about 25% - 30% which shows that
            the less popular options still have a decent amount of people
            supporting their inclusion in Splatoon 3.<br /><br />
            Out of the 174 respondents, 17.8% said there was “No changes need to
            be made” which is a lot less than expected when comparing it to
            player satisfaction of gyro controls in question 6.<br /><br />
            Finally, the “Other” option allowed for participants to write other
            accessibility options outside of the options already provided (see
            appendix A, A7). So, just under 9% of people suggested other
            options. Out of these suggestions there were a couple of repeated
            suggestions these were to allow vertical camera movement with the
            right stick when using gyro and a flick stick option for the right
            stick (the camera turns a set amount in the direction it is flicked,
            90 degrees left or right and 180 degrees when flicked down).

            alt="Graph depicting different options to improve stick controls"
          />
          <p>
            When asked about improvements that could be made for stick controls
            it is notable that all suggested options (options 1-4) are around
            the 50% - 60% range meaning that stick controls require a fair
            amount of improvement. This is also supported by 7.2% of
            participants selecting “No changes need to be made”. <br><br>
            The “Other” option account for 6.7% of users. The majority of
            answers talked about players not using stick settings or including
            more options while having gyro options enabled. I will talk about possible
            changes/improvements to the questionnaire to address these comments
            in a later section.
