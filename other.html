            This question asked if there were any other ways to improve
            accessibility options outside what was already suggested in the
            previous questions. A few responses expanded on suggestions
            mentioned in previous questions such as turbo buttons options for
            weapons outside which weren’t mentioned in question 11, more
            detailed ideas about Splattercolour Screen and other suggestions
            about button remapping. <br /><br />
            There were a few comments about supporting more types of controllers
            such as keyboard and mouse or a controller designed specifically for
            accessibility (similar to the Xbox adaptive controller). While an
            adaptive controller is a good method to improve accessibility to
            make it easier for players with physical or motor-control based
            disabilities. I classified them as outside of the scope of this
            survey since they aren’t directly a part of the video game. Lastly,
            a setting to change the aiming crosshair was mentioned which I
            thought was worth highlighting. Changing the size, shape and colour
            of the crosshair can help with visibility to make it more
            accessible. <br />
            <br />
            To summarise, there are a range of accessibility options players
            would like included that were not mentioned in the survey. Being
            able to survey your player base for their thoughts is important so
            that there is a better understanding of what players want and how
            suggestions can be incorporated into your game so that can be
            improved.
