            <h2>Other Improvemants to the Accessibility</h2>
          </summary>
          <p>
            This question asked if there were any other ways to improve
            accessibility options outside what was already suggested in the
            previous questions. A few responses expanded on suggestions
            mentioned in previous questions such as turbo buttons options for
            weapons outside which weren’t mentioned in question 11, more
            detailed ideas about Splattercolour Screen and other suggestions
            about button remapping. <br /><br />
            There were a few comments about supporting more types of controllers
            such as keyboard and mouse or a controller designed specifically for
            accessibility (similar to the Xbox adaptive controller). While an
            adaptive controller is a good method to improve accessibility to
            make it easier for players with physical or motor-control based
            disabilities. I classified them as outside of the scope of this
            survey since they aren’t directly a part of the video game. Lastly,
            a setting to change the aiming crosshair was mentioned which I
            thought was worth highlighting. Changing the size, shape and colour
            of the crosshair can help with visibility to make it more
            accessible. <br />
            <br />
            To summarise, there are a range of accessibility options players
            would like included that were not mentioned in the survey. Being
            able to survey your player base for their thoughts is important so
            that there is a better understanding of what players want and how
            suggestions can be incorporated into your game so that can be
            improved.

          <summary><h2>Survey Feedback</h2></summary>
          <p>
            I asked respondents for any feedback on how I conducted my survey to
            see if there was anything I could improve. The main comment was to
            include a neutral/not sure option for the likert questions, most
            responses said that they didn’t know about or didn’t have an opinion
            about some of the statements and a neutral option would help. When designing this survey, I decided not to
            include a neutral options because I didn’t want participants to sit
            on the fence. However, after reading the feedback some people didn’t
            feel knowledgeable enough to answer some statements in the likert
            questions meaning their selected answer did not reflect what they
            believed. This could lead to inaccurate data even if this was a
            small number of people who gave this feedback. Going forwards when
            designing another survey, I would include a “not sure” option for
            questions where the participants is not expected to know the
            answer/have an opinion (for example, question 6,7 and 8 in this
            survey). <br><br>
            Some people mentioned that some definitions were not
            clarified for example stick controls. There might be confusion
            because gyro controls also use stick controls for horizontal camera
            movement which could cause confusion. Other questions or definitions
            that caused confusion were question 3 (what counts as times per
            week) and people confusing button remapping/language settings
            already existing on the Nintendo Switch but not in Splatoon 3. How I
            would improve on this feedback in future will be addressed later on.
