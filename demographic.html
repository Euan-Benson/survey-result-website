            My survey shows that 84% of participants are under the age of 25
            which can be broken down into 24% under 18, 36% between 22 and 25
            and 24% between 26 and 29. The next 12% are aged between 26 and 37.
            This is mostly what I expected the age demographic to be since this
            game is typically advertised to a younger audience.

            The graph above shows that 42% of people play Splatoon 3 3-5 times a
            week, 25% 0-2 times, 23% 6-8 times and 10% of people playing over 8
            hours per week. This shows that the survey demographic frequently
            plays Splatoon 3, and a decent proportion play on average daily.

            This question allows multiple answers to be selected so the
            percentages are shown in the graph below. The main data to focus on
            is the gyro and motion controls since these are the only 2 control
            types. The graph shows that 90% (162) of people use gyro (motion)
            controls since gyro and stick controls can’t be active at the same
            time, this should mean that 10% of players use stick controls. This
            is not reflected by the data. This could be because there are
            players who use both types of controls or, I wasn’t specific enough
            when phrasing the question. Gyro controls have the option to
            enable/disable the right stick on the controller for horizontal
            camera movement so, the question could be vague and cause a player
            who uses gyro controls with the right stick for horizontal camera
            movement to select both “Gyro aiming” and “Stick Controls”. While
            this data may not be fully accurate it does show that a majority of
            players use gyro controls. <br /><br />
            Colour lock sets the colours used in the game to pre-set colours
            that are unable to change from match to match. The intended use for
            this is to make it easier to differentiate between their team’s
            colour and the opponent team’s colour. 12.7% of players surveyed
            used colour lock so, most players in the survey are okay with
            changing colours between matches and the colours themselves.
            <br /><br />
            Button remapping allows the re-binding of an action to a different
            button. This was used by 6.1% of players which suggests that the
            majority of players are comfortable with the default control scheme.
            <br /><br />
            External hardware and external software both have little use by
            participants in the survey (0% and 2.2% respectively). I believe
            this could be due to lack of knowledge about these options existing
            as well as Nintendo being strict on the modification of their
            software and hardware which can result in a permanent ban from
            online play making the risk not worth it. However, this cannot be
            proven with data from this survey and follow up questions would need
            to be asked. <br /><br />
            The “Other” option was selected by 3.9% of people surveyed. These
            statements expanded on what types of external hardware was used
            (e.g., 3rd party controllers) or what situations they used settings
            like colour lock or button remapping in.
