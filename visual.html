          <p>
            This question asked the participant to agree or disagree with
            statements relating to the accessibility of the visual design in
            Splatoon 3. <br><br>
            In this section the statements with the largest
            percentage of agreement are text font readability, text size, colour
            lock options, brightness of the game, menu readability and
            navigation and language options. Each statement had the following
            total agreement percentage: 98.3%, 91.3%, 77.5%, 86.8%, 97.1%,
            89.6%, 77.7% respectively. This shows the majority of people in the
            survey are satisfied with menu design (which to an extent does
            include text size and font) and suggests that it is designed well.
            Although not everyone agrees with these statements and out of the
            people who agreed, most only agree and not strongly agreed. <br><br> 
            There were also statements which most people
            disagreed with, these were statements asking about aspects of visual
            design (effects, flashing lights, screen shaking) causing
            discomfort. This shows most people do not have issues with how the
            game handles these effects however, about 20% - 30% of participants
            said that it did cause them problems. This is still a decent
            proportion of the survey population that are affected by the design
            of the game. <br><br>
            The most divisive statement was if Splattercolour
            Screen (a special weapon in the game which puts up a large screen
            that causes high levels of colour desaturation, decreased brightness
            as well as plays a buzzing audio noise when the opposing team passes
            through the screen) caused visual discomfort. This was split with
            51.7% agreeing with the statement and 48.3% and a relatively even
            split between each of the options (from 9.8% to 25.3% with most
            around 15%). This is a large number of players that are negatively
            affected by a single item in the game especially considering the
            developers have tried to change it previously to cause less
            discomfort.

          />
          <p>
            The percentage for answers varied greater compared to the other
            questions in this section, ranging from 12.1% - 67.2% (excluding no
            changes and other). The most popular options were “Increased colour
            lock options” (67.2%) then “Customize colour combinations” (61.1%).
            The least popular options were “Camera field of view slider” and
            “Button cooldown option when progressing text” with 12.1% and 12.2%
            respectively (see appendix A, A12). I believe increased colour
            options and colour customisation might not be linked to
            accessibility for some people, this is because it is a commonly
            requested aesthetic feature that has function beyond accessibility.
            Understanding why players chose certain features/settings would need
            to be looked into in future survey. <br /><br />
            The “Other” option was selected by 5.6% of people and included
            suggestions such as having a setting to remove bright flashes,
            colour blind filters and disable other in game particle effect (such
            as warping, sparks, flashes).
