          />
          <p>
            This question and the other questions in this section asked a series
            of statements relating to a specific aspect of accessibility design
            and how much participants agreed or disagreed with those statements.
            When looking at how people responded to that question it shows that
            there was mostly a strong agreement/disagreement with only a couple
            of statements which received a mixed response. <br /><br />
            Some of the strongest responses were to the statements asking about
            gyro controls where about 75% or more people agreed with the
            statements. In particular, 58.6% of participants strongly agreed
            that gyro controls felt comfortable to use and 34.5% strongly
            agreeing that gyro controls had a large and varied range of
            sensitivity settings. Participants also agreed that vibration
            feedback from the controller was comfortable although, less people
            strongly agreed compared to the previous statements. Finally, most
            people agreed that when the game requires you to rapidly press a
            button on the controller, it was uncomfortable. <br /><br />
            There were two statements that respondents mostly disagreed with.
            These included stick controls being comfortable and holding down
            buttons for inputs being uncomfortable, 72.1% and 76.2% respectively
            disagreed with the statements. <br /><br />
            Some statements received mixed responses, these included stick
            controls having a variety of settings to customise, stick controls
            having a large range of sensitivity options and button mapping
            having a variety of remapping options. These statements saw an
            agree/disagree split of 48.3%/51.7%, 58%/42% and 43.1%/56.9%
            respectively. For these statements there was a much more even
            proportion of agreement and disagreement. Overall, this shows people
            are generally happy with the current implementation of gyro controls
            and their settings as well as the vibration feedback from the
            controller. Opinions about stick controls were a lot more mixed with
            the comfortability of stick controls being a main issue for people.
            Lastly, button mapping and rapid button pressing were also seen as
            problems.

          <img

          <p>
            The percentage for answers varied greater compared to the other
            questions in this section, ranging from 12.1% - 67.2% (excluding no
            changes and other). The most popular options were “Increased colour
            lock options” (67.2%) then “Customize colour combinations” (61.1%).
            The least popular options were “Camera field of view slider” and
            “Button cooldown option when progressing text” with 12.1% and 12.2%
            respectively (see appendix A, A12). I believe increased colour
            options and colour customisation might not be linked to
            accessibility for some people, this is because it is a commonly
            requested aesthetic feature that has function beyond accessibility.
            Understanding why players chose certain features/settings would need
            to be looked into in future survey. <br><br>
            The “Other” option was selected
            by 5.6% of people and included suggestions such as having a setting
            to remove bright flashes, colour blind filters and disable other in
            game particle effect (such as warping, sparks, flashes).
